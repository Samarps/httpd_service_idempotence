# Retaining Idempotence using Handlers

I've created an Ansible Playbooks which retains the imdempotency of the Ansible Playbook during Httpd (Apache Webserver) restart service task using the concept of Handlers. This same can be used to in other cases to retain the idempotency to save resources & cost.

Ansible is a great tool for Configuration Management & Automation. This Task was given by Sir Vimal Daga in the Arth training recently.

## ARTH Task 11.3
- Restarting HTTPD (Apache Webserver) Service is not idempotent in nature & also consumes more resources. Suggest a way to rectify this challenge in Ansible PlayBook.

Hope you guys learned something new. Thankyou, I'll meet you in the next one. ðŸ˜Š
